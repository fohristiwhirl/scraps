  <h1 align="left">Overview</h1>
  <p align="left">Several popular formats exist for digital image files, usually 
  referred to by the file extension used. The more common formats include BMP, 
  JPG, GIF, and PNG. As is typically the case, there are pros and cons 
  associated with each format. From the standpoint of gaining familiarity with 
  the subject of image files, the Windows BMP file offers significant advantages 
  because of its simplicity. It also has the advantage of being highly 
  standardized and extremely widespread. Its principal disadvantage is it does 
  not support effective image compression except on specific types of images. 
  However, there is a hidden benefit to this shortcoming. Since other image file 
  formats do offer significant data compression, very few images stored in BMP 
  format are compressed and, therefore, a very simple BMP editor that doesn't 
  support working with compressed BMP files will seldom encounter a file it 
  can't work.</p>
  <p align="left">The information contained here is very minimal. A much more 
  thorough treatment of image file formats can be found in such texts as <i>
  Compressed File Formats </i>by John Miano.</p>
  <p align="left">The Windows BMP file format dates back nearly two decades and 
  several incompatible versions existed at one time. However, since Microsoft 
  has full control of the format definition, these older forms are virtually 
  never encountered and the format has been very stable since the version 
  released with Windows 3.0. Certainly enhancements have been added to the 
  format definition since then, but they have occurred in an upwardly compatible 
  fashion.</p>
  <p align="left">The file is a binary file (as opposed to a text file) that is 
  separated into four sections (though one, the color table, does not always 
  exist). The sections, in order from the start of the file, is the File Header, 
  the Image Header, the Color Table, and finally the Pixel Data itself. The File 
  Header is used primarily for the accessing software to confirm that the file 
  is (at least probably) a BMP file, to tell exactly how large the file is, and 
  to learn where the actual image data is located within the file. The Image 
  Header gives the detailed information about the image and its data format such 
  as the height and width of the image, how many bits are used per pixel, and 
  whether the image data is compressed or not. The Color Table may or may not be 
  present, depending on the format of the image data. When it does exist, it is 
  either a color palette or a set of bitmasks used to extract the color 
  information from the image data. Finally, the rest of the file is the image 
  data itself. Each of these four sections is discussed in some detail below.</p>
  <h1 align="left">The File Header&nbsp; </h1>
  <p align="left">The File Header has exactly fourteen bytes in it. The first 
  two bytes must be the ASCII codes for the characters 'B' and 'M'. The software 
  should check these values to confirm that the file it is reading is most 
  probably a Windows BMP file. The second field is a four byte integer the 
  contains the size of the file in bytes. The third and fourth fields are each 
  two bytes long and are reserved for future extensions to the format 
  definition. The present definition requires that both of these fields be zero. 
  The final four byte field is an integer that gives the offset of the start of 
  the Pixel Data section relative to the start of the file.</p>

  <h1 align="left">The Image Header</h1>
  <p align="left">There are actually two distinct options for the Image Header - 
  one that was developed for the OS/2 BMP format and one that is for the Windows 
  BMP format. The OS/2 Image Header is exactly 12 bytes long while the Windows 
  Image Header is at least 40 bytes long. Fortunately, the first four bytes of 
  each format is the length of the Image Header in bytes and therefore a simple 
  examination of this value tells you which format is being used. While the 
  Windows Image Header allows headers longer than 40 bytes and this was 
  supported by Windows 95, few applications ever adopted it.</p>
  <p align="left">At this point we will make the first of a few decisions on how 
  we wish to limit the scope of our program's capabilities. The issue is trading 
  off simplicity for capability. Given the purpose of this program - namely to 
  introduce the topic of binary files and image file manipulation and to provide 
  a means for your programs to generate quality images - it is entirely 
  reasonable to select a very narrowly defined range of image format that our 
  program will be able to work. The program's capabilities can always be 
  expanded later.</p>
  <p align="left">For simplicity, we will therefore choose to limit our program 
  to being able to work with BMP files that use a Windows Image Header that is 
  exactly 40 bytes in length - it turns out that this is not much of a 
  restriction since few BMP files use any of the alternatives). In addition, we 
  will choose to limit our program to working only with uncompressed image files 
  - and again it turns out that this is not much of a restriction since few BMP 
  files are compressed in the first place. </p>
  <p align="left">However, we will be placing a noticeable restriction on 
  ourselves by limiting the bitcounts (the number of bits of data per pixel) 
  that our program will support. The presently allowable bitcounts for Windows 
  BMP files are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32. Bitcounts that are one byte or 
  smaller are palletized meaning that the individual pixel data is actually the 
  number of a palette entry - much along the lines of a &quot;paint-by-number&quot; 
  painting. The multi-byte bitcounts are so called &quot;true color&quot; bitmaps because 
  each entry contains the full color information for that pixel. </p>
  <p align="left">Of the true color bitcounts, the only one we will support is 
  the 8-bit format. This allows a color palette with 256 entries which is more 
  than sufficient to render amazingly impressive computer graphics although it's 
  limitations are generally readily apparent when dealing with photographic 
  images. Extending our program to support the lower bitcounts is reasonably 
  straightforward.</p>
  <p align="left">Of the true color bitcounts, the only one we will support is 
  the 24-bit format. In this format, the color information for each pixel is 
  contained in three contiguous bytes of data with one byte for blue, green, and 
  red respectively. The 16 and 32 bit options involve the use of bitmasks to 
  separate out the color components. The primary advantage of these two options 
  is that most modern processors are better suited to reading and writing data 
  in 16 and/or 32 bit blocks than in individual bytes. This was probably an 
  attempt to be able to read and write the image data to and from slower 
  secondary storage devices faster but, if speed is an issue, most people opt 
  for one of the compressed file formats. As a result, these options are 
  relatively rare and we are not sacrificing much by not supporting them. </p>

  <p align="left">For our purposes, we can ignore the last five fields.</p>
  <h1 align="left">The Color Table</h1>
  <p align="left">If we are dealing with a 24-bit image, then there is no Color 
  Table present. If we are dealing with an 8-bit Windows (as opposed to OS/2) 
  BMP image then the Color Table consists of 256 entries with each entry 
  consisting of four bytes of data. The first three byte are the blue, green, 
  and red color values respectively. The fourth byte is unused and must be equal 
  to zero. The only difference between the Windows and the OS/2 version is that 
  the latter does not have this fourth byte.</p>
  <h1 align="left">The Pixel Data</h1>
  <p>In the 8-bit format, each pixel is represented by a single byte of data, 
  that byte is an index into the Color Table. In the 24-bit format, each pixel 
  is represented by three consecutive bytes of data that specify the blue, 
  green, and red component values respectively.</p>
  <p>The pixel data in a BMP file is scan line padded to a 32-bit (4-byte)
  boundary. What this means is that if you have a 1071x363 24-bit image, that
  each scan line (one row of data in the image) consists of 363 pixels each of
  which requires 3-bytes (24-bits) to encode. Thus you have 1,089 bytes of data
  per line. The format requires that scan lines be multiples of 4-bytes so 3
  null bytes (value is zero) are added to the end of the data for each line to
  make a total of 1,092 (4x273) bytes per line.</p>
